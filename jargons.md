The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It's technical name in Git parlance is the "index", but the phrase "staging area" works just as well.

## HEAD

HEAD is a pointer that points to the tip commit of current branch.

You can see what HEAD points to by doing:

`cat .git/HEAD`

example output: `ref: refs/heads/main`

It is possible for HEAD to refer to a specific revision that is not associated with a branch name. This situation is called a [detached head](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head)

## Ref

A git reference (git ref) is a file that contains a git commit SHA-1 hash.
