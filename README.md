Git is a distributed SCM(source control management) tool. It's safe, flexible, efficient but *complicated*. Aside from its numerous commands, sometimes you has to understand how it works internally to use it well :(

Suppose you go through all the hurdles to try to understand its internals (you know git is a content-addressable file system, it uses SHA-1, it's model for storage is linkage between commit -> tree -> blob), you still have to learn how to use it's command line interface which can be daunting to look at. Never the less we have to use it just because it's popular.

This repo is my notes on how to use git & use it well.
